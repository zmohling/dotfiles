# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for Arch-based Linux. Advocate of the *Solarize Everything* movement. I use `scripts/solarized_toggle.sh` to toggle the colorscheme between solarized light and solarized dark via terminal. I prefer the light theme, but it burns my eyes at night. Burns. My. Eyes.

>*It ain't much, but it's honest work.*
